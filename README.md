# mad-tools
I've created this as fun. In this repo i've used free API services and created a funny tool. 
It predicts your gender using your name with API "https://api.genderize.io?name=Rushi", 
your nationality using your name with API "https://api.nationalize.io?name=Rushi",
your age using name with API "https://api.agify.io/?name=Rushi" this API services are free 
I've also designed a calculator and a unit conversion tool.
and a tool to know universities their address and websites using API "http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?name=Indian+Institute+of+Technology"
